# DevOps Lab
Personal Playground, Laboratory, and Mini-Infrastructure for DevOps.


Started with Vagrant & Make, then Taskfile.yml and Docker-Compose, and now with:
- Task (with Taskfile.yml)
- Ansible
- Docker and Sysbox
- Hashicorp Nomad
- Terraform


## What I may change ...
- Change Nomad to k3s
- Integrate Service Mesh and Service Discovery with Consul (because Nomad)
- Integrate Tools for Operations Management (Prometheus and Grafana)
  - Or maybe with Python's watchdog
- Add Sysbox Image Building Pipelines with Hashicorp Packer
